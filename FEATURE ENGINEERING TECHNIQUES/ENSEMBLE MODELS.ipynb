    "Adaptive boosting or AdaBoost is one of the simplest boosting algorithms. Usually, decision trees are used for modelling. Multiple sequential models are created, each correcting the errors from the last model. AdaBoost assigns weights to the observations which are incorrectly predicted and the subsequent model works to predict these values correctly.\n",
